      <p>Hi there! My name is Ishani. I'm a rising junior studying Computer Science with a minor in Machine Learning at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. I live 
         in Cupertino, CA but I'm originally from Pune, India. </p>
      <p>At CMU, I have taken a wide variety of <a href="#coursework">courses</a> on topics such as Theoretical Computer Science, Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Systems, Type Theory and
          Probability and Statistics. In addition, during my sophomore year (2019-2020), I served as a research assistant on <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~janh/">Prof. Jan Hoffman's</a> team. 
          As a research assistant, I worked on Nomos, a programming language for smart contracts. I added functional constructs to the language, developed a theory for its subtyping and implemented 
          this algorithm in the typechecker. I also served as an <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/programs/excel.html">EXCEL Leader</a> during the 2019-2020 school year. As an EXCEL Leader for 
          classes on Discrete Math and 3D-Calc, I conducted weekly sessions of 6-10 students, prepared handouts for the sessions, and implemented various
          collaborative learning techniques in my sessions. Click <a href="/files/resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> to view a copy of my resume.</p>
      <p>In the summer of 2019, I interned at the IBM TJ Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, NY on the Cloud Resource Management Team. As an intern, I contributed to the development
          of a Kubernetes Operator that handled the queueing, dispatching and resource management of Apache Spark jobs in a multi-cluster environment. I implemented features to make the operator
          more applicable to a wide range of use cases and to quickly detect job failures for redispatch. I also carried out performance testing for the operator. In the summer of 2020, I was a STEP 
          Intern at Google.
      <p>In my free time, I like reading fantasy novels, cooking and playing games. I love listening to music, especially Hindi music. Recently, I got into Bollywood Dance and I'm working on getting better at it.
         My dad is a software engineer at SAP while my mom is a part-time teacher. My older sister Shibani is a PhD student at MIT. Click <a href="gallery.html">here</a> to see photos of my life!

    <ol id="projects">
        <li>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/ankushdas/Nomos">Nomos - CMU CS Department</a></h3>
        <p>
            Nomos is a programming language for smart contracts based on session types. As a part of this project, I:
            <ul id="nomos">
                <li> Wrote a parser, type checker and interpreter for the functional layer of Nomos.</li>
                <li> Integrated this typechecker with that for the session-typed layer of Nomos to build a bidirectional typechecker for the combined language.</li>
                <li> Developed the theory and implementation for the subtyping of Nomos.</li>
                <li> Implemented several smart contracts such as a puzzle, a wallet and a bank account in Nomos.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Summer 2019 Internship Project - IBM Research</h3>
        <p>
            In this project, I leveraged Go, Kubernetes and Shell Scripts to:
            <ul id="ibm">
                <li> Build a Kubernetes operator that handles resource management, queueing and dispatching of Apache Spark jobs in a multi-cluster environment, with an emphasis on making the operator code as generic as possible.</li>
                <li> Develop a Kubernetes "Failfast" operator that allows users to configure policies for marking jobs as failed and ready for redispatch.</li>
                <li> Investigate and carry out performance testing on the Google Spark-on-k8s-Operator.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/vandanasub/TartanHacks2019">Study Buddy - Tartan Hacks 2019</a></h3>
        <p>
            In this project, we:
            <ul id="studybuddy">
                <li> Developed a SaaS application that scanned handwritten or typed notes, converted them into text and highlighted
                     important phrases to allow readers to quickly extract key information from the document.</li>
                <li> Utilized Bootstrap to automatically create and display flashcards of key concepts from the text.</li>
            </ul><br>
            The application was built in Python and deployed on Microsoft Azure.
